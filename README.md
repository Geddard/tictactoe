# TIC TAC TOE

* Setup:

1) Make sure you have the latest stable Node (5.10.1 and later are ok) and NPM versions.

2) For development builds you need to have Ruby and the scss-lint gem installed:

    Steps:

    a) sudo apt-get install ruby
    b) gem install scss_lint

3) Run "npm install".

* Start the app:

    Option 1) Run "gulp heroku:production" for production build, then "node server.js" to start the server.

    Option 2) Run "gulp" for dev build, nodemon will start node by itself.

2) Open "http://localhost:3000" in any browser to start the app.
